# Map Animation

### Project Description
Map Animation uses an animated marker to show the bus stops in 1000 millisecond increments on a map between MIT and Harvard by using the bus stop coordinates. 

### How to Run
Download the files into a single top level directory and open the HTML file in a browser. Press the "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard" button to start the animation. 

### Roadmap of future improvements
Future improvements include finer transitions between the stops or including live data from the bus systems that show the current location of the bus.
